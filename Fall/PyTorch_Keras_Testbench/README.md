Run testbench.py to start the testbench.
Testbench uses LSTM2.py and RNN3.py for the models, tb_util.py for common utilities used in the testbench.

After models are finished, type fig1.show() for training losses graph and fig2.show() for validation graph.

To change data set, go into code and change the file name on line 23. You will also need to change the input size on line 2.
